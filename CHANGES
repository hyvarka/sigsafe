sigsafe-0.1.2
-------------

* Added preliminary support for FreeBSD. (See RELEASE_NOTES.)

* A bit more documentation work. (More needed!)

* Added a test for sigsafe_select in the race checker, and found/fixed a bug
  that meant 4- and 5-argument system calls would not work properly under
  Linux/x86. (D'oh!)

* Added some additional tests for things that don't appear to be actual
  problems. Good.

sigsafe-0.1.1
-------------

* Documentation improvements: a better quick overview, the start of some
  background text, and a couple other pages that I will bulk out more later.
  It should be more a little more friendly to different audiences now.
  (There's still a ways to go.)

* Big improvements to the race condition checker. It now tests for more races
  (including a couple unsafe patterns I mentioned in the Background text),
  shows a nice table with actual/expected results, is much faster for a normal
  run, and lets you specify options at runtime.

* A new directory of tests - platform_behavior. Little experiments I ran on
  various platforms when the API confused me, where I was looking for bugs,
  or where behavior can vary from platform to platform. These might or might
  not be useful beyond when I wrote them, but I might as well stick them
  somewhere.

* Small build system changes - mostly fixing a bunch of typos/thinkos around
  the benchmark.

sigsafe-0.1.0
-------------

* (Initial version)
