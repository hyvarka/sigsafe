sigsafe-0.1.1
-------------

* Documentation improvements: a better quick overview, the start of some
  background text, and a couple other pages that I will bulk out more later.
  It should be more a little more friendly to different audiences now.
  (There's still a ways to go.)

* Big improvements to the race condition checker. It now tests for more races
  (including a couple unsafe patterns I mentioned in the Background text),
  shows a nice table with actual/expected results, is much faster for a normal
  run, and lets you specify options at runtime.

* A new directory of tests - platform_behavior. Little experiments I ran on
  various platforms when the API confused me, where I was looking for bugs,
  or where behavior can vary from platform to platform. These might or might
  not be useful beyond when I wrote them, but I might as well stick them
  somewhere.

* Small build system changes - mostly fixing a bunch of typos/thinkos around
  the benchmark.
