A project I'm toying with, to implement a truly efficient, safe, reliable
method of delivering signals to specific threads.

Thread cancellation really accomplishes 99% of what I want to do here, but
unfortunately thread cancellation does not work. (See the cancellation_tests
directory for justification of that statement.)

To really do this well, I would need to write assembly code for each
combination of operating system and processor on which I want to run my code.
So far I have done so only for Darwin/ppc.
