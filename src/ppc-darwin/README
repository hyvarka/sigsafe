These resources are helpful for writing ppc-darwin assembly:

- <http://cvs.opendarwin.org/index.cgi/src/Libc/ppc/sys/>
  Apple's implementation of these functions.

- <http://cvs.opendarwin.org/index.cgi/src/xnu/osfmk/ppc/hw_exception.s>
  The kernel's system call entry code - see "shandler".
  It's a little...dense...but it might be helpful.

- <http://www.securiteam.com/securityreviews/PPC_OSX_Shellcode_Assembly.pdf>
  A paper about ppc/darwin shellcode, but it has some useful small examples.

- /usr/include/architecture/ppc/reg_help.h
  Describes register usage

- /usr/incldue/architecture/ppc/asm_help.h
  Describes stack layout and has lots of helpful macros
