sigsafe version 0.1.2 release notes:

* The FreeBSD/x86 support is preliminary:

  - It doesn't like FreeBSD 4.8's -pthread argument to link with a user
    threading package, and I don't ever intend to try supporting it.
    (Symptoms: simple_test will return EAGAIN if no input is available when it
    does the read.) I'd like to hear about successes or failures with
    LinuxThreads on FreeBSD 4.* or KSEs on FreeBSD 5.*.

  - The race condition checker doesn't work here, either. No si_code
    constants; probably not too hard to fix, but I haven't yet.

* The documentation is improved, but it still has a ways to go:

  - The "Background" section stops abruptly. There are a lot more topics to
    cover.
  - The "Pattern reference" could use more explanation and should be adapted
    to use the same terminology.
  - The "Goal reference" doesn't really exist yet.

  If you spot anything wrong with what's already there, please let me know. If
  it's unclear to you, odds are it is to someone else, too. And if it seems
  wrong to you, let me know so I can correct or justify it.

  Patches to add new documentation are also welcome. But saying "it's just not
  there" doesn't help - I already know that.

* The race checker is in pretty good shape now on Linux/x86.
  Try it out with "tests/race_checker/race_checker -qm" for a quick test.

* The race checker still doesn't work under Darwin. It will give
  results like this:

    $ ./race_checker -qm
    Running sigsafe_read test
    attached
    stepped once

    ERROR: Child was killed/dump from signal 1.

    ...

      Test                 Result               Expected            
    ----------------------------------------------------------------
    * sigsafe_read         misc. failure        success             
    * racebefore_read      misc. failure        ignored signal      
    * raceafter_read       misc. failure        forgotten result    

    * - These 3 tests did not return the expected result.

  The child isn't exiting from signal 1; the Mach tracing code I'm using just
  isn't working. As far as I know, sigsafe works fine under Darwin.
